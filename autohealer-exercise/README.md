# AUTO-HEALER  

In cloud computing, auto-healing is a feature used to monitor a cluster and detect faulty application instances.

If a faulty instance is detected, the node is shut down and a new node is created with a healthy application instance.

In this practical assignment we will implement a very basic auto healer which will monitor a group of worker instances.
